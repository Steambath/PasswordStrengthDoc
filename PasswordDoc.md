# Password Documentation
Passwords are a form of authentication that serve as a key to verify the identity of an individual. They are strings of characters that a person must remember and use to gain access to various systems or accounts. A password acts as a secure identifier, ensuring that only the rightful user can access their personal data or services.
Passwords can be used in multiple forms, from websites for users personal accounts, individual applications and services externally outside of the browser. To even users work machines, it being commonly used everywhere where identifiers are put in place.
Despite the growing alternatives in place like biometrics, and one time passwords, passwords are still widely used within all services. This is due to multiple reasons.
- **Simple implementation** for developers
- **Minimal development knowledge** required to integreat passwords
- **Wide support** across services and applications with tools built in and avaliable on all services
- **Universal applicability**, working across a vast amount of applications types, without causing compatability issues or dependancies needed for other applications
With this in mind passwords are likely going to remain a key security tool for a large amount of time. However this is only based on the user's behaviour and attitude to passwords. Therefore its essential as a security measure, and important for a user to understand keep secure password hygiene.

## What makes a password insecure
Passwords come in multiple forms and sizes. This being an identifier and authentication type to prove that the individual are entering, proving who they are. This being stated to be based on the user. Nonetheless it won't matter if the password is insecure. 
### Insecurity
**Insecurity** in the context of a password, means that identifier is easy to guess, crack or compromise in some other way by an unauthorised actors. An insecure password fails to provide adequate protection against common attacking methods. 
These being brute forcing, dictionary attacks or social engineering. 
The key factors contributing to an individuals password being insecure include: 
### **Short Length**
Less characters in a password leads to easier guessing and cracking of passwords. If a password is shorter there are less combinations therefore meaning it can be cracked quicker. In combination to the increase in computing power meaning more guesses can be made, means passwords can be guessed quicker. 
Imagine a password being 3 characters long. 
If a password can have lower/upper case, digits and special characters menaing there can be 94 possible characters.
There can only be 830,584 (94^3). Which for a computer is very little time for how many possible combinations it sounds. 
### **Common/Predictable Passwords**
Using predictable passwords like, `password`, `qwerty`, `letmein` and others makes it easier for attackers to gain access. Due to the laziness of individuals or overall annoyance due to multiple reasons. These passwords can be brute-forced or dictionary attacks.
Surprisingly `password` is still a very common password, due to password rules not being implemented on website or by organisations. Therefore making it a first guess for individuals.
### **Personal Information**
Easily guessable personal details (birthdays, username, pet names) make it easier for an individual to guess your password. If this information is easily accessible online due to you actively putting it up (social media) it makes to easier for malicious actors to gain this information making guesses. 
As well as other tools having information to scrape and collect the information automatically making it easier to guess.
If your birthday includes is something like a pet named `Emily` using a password like `Emily1234` could be used or `PetEmily1234` is an insecure choice as this can be guessed by malicious actors.  
### **Lack of Complexity**
If a password is too simple, i.e. not including special characters, digits, and upper and lower case, this makes it easier for automated tools to guess. This is due to having less combinations which can be guessed for a password. Meaning it will take less time to process out a response of guesses. The same applies if its known guessable words, as they maybe at the top of dictionary attacks or included in those lists as they are a combination of words people use.
Say if an individual had a password only made up of upper case characters at a length of 8 digits, this would only mean 26 combinations of characters for 6 characters. Meaning a guess of only 308915776 (26^6) combinations which won't take a machine long to automate and go through that process. 
However if an individual has a special character, a digit and lower/upper case within the password, it means 94 possible combinations are avaliable for a single word, taking 308915776 (26^6) to 689869781056 (94^6) which is less feasable for a computer to guess.
### **Reused Passwords**
It's also important to not reuse passwords. Your password may already be avaliable on a website that has already been compromised originally. Therefore meaning it is in a wordlist a malicious individual can use to brute force other websites and accounts. Meaning your other logins can also be compromised due to using the same password. 
To check what accounts your details have been compromised on you can look at https://haveibeenpwned.com/ 
This checking if the individual breaches have effected your account and take action accordingly.
